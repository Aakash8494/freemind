      In this lesson of the Iron Mine Course is going to be a happy lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our previous lessons were about creating enemies and understanding that you have to fight a battle against the enemy you create and how difficult life can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this lesson we're going to do something that's a little bit more positive so you can smile.

    <p>
      And what we're going to do is we're going to talk about <b>gratitude</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned the hard way that it is <b><i>impossible to be grateful for things that you have in abundance. </i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows this. I'm stating the obvious here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone talks about how if you were<b>&#160;born a millionaire</b>&#160;kid you wouldn't appreciate money.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It's absolutely the same but absolutely everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how hard to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How hard do you try and check yourself and appreciate your current situation</b>?
    </p>
    <p>
      You're never going to appreciate if you have in abundance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to be grateful for your life and appreciate things is to<b><u>&#160;self-censor. </u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this takes self-control but we've already discussed how your <b>enemy has self-control</b>&#160;and how you're going to compete against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're going to need self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for this reason you now have self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to tell you something.
    </p>
    <p>
      By<b>&#160;reducing your time spent</b>&#160;or money spent or energy spent on the <b>things you like</b>&#160;not only do you become a more productive worker you get more stuff done but too you appreciate those things more and <b>you end up genuinely happier. </b>

    </p>
    <p>
      So I'll give you some examples. It's a sunny day today.
    </p>
    <p>
      On sunny days I like driving my Lamborghini around and showing off and <b>sometimes</b>&#160; when I really feel I driving it I don't want that myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll take a bike and I'll go pedal my bike <b>instead</b>&#160;or I'll train extra hours in a gym or I'll do some work.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when<b>&#160;I really want to drive it </b>even though I have the time to drive it even though I could drive it <b>I do not drive it. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And the reason I do that is I deliberately prevent myself from doing something I want so when I get back in that car the next day or a couple days <b><i><u>later I appreciate it. </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      If I drove the car <b>anytime</b>&#160;I wanted to I might still even like it I might still enjoy it but I will <b>never appreciate it. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when I get in that car I appreciate my car and that's because I stop myself from using it as often as I want to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><u><i>Humans were never built for the abundance we live in today. </i></u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>We live in an abundance which we were never designed to have. </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>We were designed to barely barely scrape enough calories from the surroundings to survive and sit around in the dirt wishing for more than what we had. </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      We were not designed to be able to get food any time we wanted that's why people are fat to get satisfaction and entertainment any time we wanted that's why people can't be attention anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The human mind is not evolved to live the life we're living.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you have two choices you need a cave to that completely and you're given the consumerism and you end up obese and have attention deficit disorder because you're too busy watching YouTube videos to concentrate anything important or you sense yourself and you prevent yourself from having as much as you want and that's how you build an iron mindset.

    <p>
      So I'm gonna give you a few examples of things you can do because now I know not all of you have Lamborghini's that was a pretty first world example but I'll give you some other examples of things that I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I actually developed this and learned this tactic when I was fighting because fighting makes you sensor yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're training for a fight you can't drink alcohol you have to eat correctly you have to sleep correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when my fight camp would be over the idea of staying up late and having a beer and eating an ice cream was amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To most people that's every fucking day and they don't give a shit but to me the idea of just cracking open a beer and drinking it and not thinking about it as anything other than well a beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      When I did that after a fight camp I was smiling ear to ear genuinely because I had a touch out call for eight weeks so by preventing myself from having alcohol not only was I more grateful in the end like people had beer all the time and it doesn't make them happy it's just something they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was I more grateful in the end not only was I happier I was also a better physical condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also didn't spend money on beer and this is the exact point if you were to script yourself from the things you want not only to enjoy the more in the end not only do you <b><u>end up happier you usually end up in better physical financial shape for it. </u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      So there's a whole bunch of stuff you do right now that you enjoy everyone has things they enjoy and that's fine you absolutely should have things you enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've made your list of your enemy obviously he's a machine he's a robot he doesn't waste much time but we're all humans you're competing with him but there's still some things you enjoy which aren't completely essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to learn to <b>restrict</b>&#160;those things or <b>delay</b>&#160;those things so that you appreciate them more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happiness and gratefulness are basically the same thing if you're grateful for what you have you're gonna be a pretty happy person and a happy mind is an iron mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of being a robot and being I've got an iron mind nothing affects me that's not that's not good life a good life is a happy person who when the struggles of life come they can just glide over the bumps that's the kind of person you want to be and you're gonna do that by making yourself more grateful and you make yourself more <b>grateful through scarcity. </b>

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      So across the next couple of days here's what I want you to do I want you to choose each day if you're gonna allow yourself to <b>eat</b>&#160;or to <b>drink</b>&#160;you have to make a choice <b><i><u>because these are things you do every day you eat some food you drink some water and you don't care about it</u></i>&#160;</b>and you don't grateful for either one. So each day you're gonna wake up and you're gonna decide I'm either gonna drink whatever I want today coffee water orange juice smoothie whatever or I'm gonna eat whatever I want today and I'm gonna be thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of either one of those days you're gonna be pissed off you made the choice you made and you would wish you made the other one and you'd be grateful for all the times you've had a meal with a nice cold glass of water with it or all the times you had a cold glass of water with a nice meal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next three or four days you have to make a choice each morning stick to it don't be a pussy you've had enough of the other lessons if you're struggling to stick to it watch the other videos don't be a pussy and choose next three or four days choose food or water.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the <b>four</b>&#160;days you can allow yourself to have both together and you'll feel a <b>whole new appreciation</b>&#160;for the most basic thing in the world a meal and a cold glass of water I guarantee you because for three or four days it was always a choice you're waking up in the morning you wake up your mouth's dry but your hungry is fucked from yesterday <b><i><u>so which one is it</u></i><u>&#160;</u></b>you have to make the choice so when you get to a situation you can have two things together two very basic simple things together you're gonna appreciate both of them more so this is the first exercise you're gonna do across the next three or four days

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      the idea being is you need to <b><i><u>learn how to remember that feeling</u></i></b>&#160; now i know this sounds stupid but feelings can be remembered if you listen to a sad song or if you think about sad event the feeling comes back you remember the feeling people very <b>rarely remember gratefulness</b>&#160;they <b>don't remember feeling content </b>with something so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put yourself in position of stress you're gonna relieve that stress you're gonna feel content and then you're gonna try and remember that feeling everything about it remember how you're sitting remember where you are remember that feeling and give yourself a memory that you can resort to revert back to any time in the future and you will automatically feel grateful
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      so I have this from fighting I can literally right now I can think back to that time when I just lost ten kilos and been in the sauna for two days and hadn't had a drop of water and lost all that weight and I had my first glass of water I can remember that and I'm smiling <b>already look at me</b>&#160;genuinely I can remember how that felt because I've had these extreme situations super extreme situations whereas when they were relieved I remember how thankful I was so I have countless memories in my life that I can revert back to that allow me to instantly feel grateful for why I have right now for the most basic things in the world
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      money is another fantastic thing to do is with right now check your bank account hopefully you're broke if you're broke this is really easy check your bank right now you broke okay good when you get some money in your bank and you smile remember that feeling
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      this video is a short video but this is very very important you can email me now after watching this video and tell me what you're gonna do to put yourself in a position of stress how you're gonna relieve it and then once you've relieved it once you are sitting there and you're feeling content and happy you need to remember that feeling
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      and I want you to email it to me and describe it to me now this isn't gonna work if you don't put yourself in a situation of extreme stress if you're thirsty for 30 minutes then have a class of water you're not gonna be happy enough to be able to hack your brain to truly remember that feeling <b>you need to suffer gentlemen </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      you need to be two hours sleep the night for two days in a row or
    </p>
    <p>
      the no food no water back and forth I don't care if it takes a week two weeks until you literally can't handle it anymore
    </p>
    <p>
      and when you're on absolute edge that's when you give in is only then you'll be able to hack your brain to remember that memory
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      you need a plethora of memories in your mind that you can revert to that will instantly make you happy and grateful and feel gratitude for what you have if you have those things you can reserve to anytime you want it's almost like being a like pop-I you can bust out the spinach anytime you need it and that's genuinely the way I live my life and I'm a happy person but I've ever pissed off or really really stressed or I'm working going right and my Lamborghini won't start and girl one of my girlfriends being a dick and the well the electricity bill at six grand and whatever whatever whatever whenever
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I can sit there and go yeah pop at least I'm up broke because when I was broke and I could think about that exact memory or I can sit and go at least I have water I think about that exact memory and I will smile regardless for water
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I can be the most fucked up situation in the world I kind of a glass of water and I'll be happy and that's what you're gonna learn to do
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      so put together your scenarios of giving you the scenario of <b>sleep</b>&#160;that's an easy one I've given you the one with <b>food or water</b>&#160;it's another easy one in general this is a good habit to learn to restrict yourself from doing the things you really want to do because you're gonna appreciate them more and you're also gonna be financially importantly healthier so you should also look at what you're doing with your spare time in general and reduce it next time you want to do something this time you want to watch a <b>YouTube</b>&#160;video you want to do something stupid go no I'm not gonna do it today<b>&#160;I'm gonna do it tomorrow</b>&#160;make yourself wait because you'll appreciate it more when you do it and I want you to put yourself in a situation of <b><i><u>extreme stress</u></i></b>&#160;gentlemen it has to be extreme when you lay in bed after being that tired for that long and you feel completely just you don't give a shit about anything else you're so happy to just be in bed remember that feeling because that's the memory you're gonna be able to go back to anytime
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      feel free to email me your ideas feel free to email me and what I want you to do is email me how it feels if you <b>email me how it feels </b>when you finally get that relief and you finally feel that gratitude email that to me because if you write out an email and explain it to me then you're gonna do far better at memorizing the memory you do far better at hacking your brain and it's gonna be a far better attempt to have something you'd revert to at any time that'll instantly lighten your mood
    </p>
