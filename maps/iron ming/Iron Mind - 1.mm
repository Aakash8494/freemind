      Welcome to the 6 week Iron Mind training.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've bought this course you may have seen one of my first videos if not the link is going to be below here where I explained the <b>secrets</b>&#160; to having an Iron Mind set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      So I'm going to preach the <b>virtues</b>&#160;of an Iron Mind set.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know all of you bought this because you understand how important it is to have a mindset of Iron, but I'm going to sit here and once I get explain to you how <b>different the world is</b>&#160;when you have a <b>mind</b>&#160; which isn't warped and <b>affected easily</b>&#160;by <b>outside influences.</b>

    <p>
      You are never going to become a robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is nothing to do with not feeling emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is nothing to do with just becoming an empty emotionless void of a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's not what this is.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is about understanding that you're a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're going to feel emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a beautiful thing and making sure that you <b>use them in the correct way</b>. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      And B. you <b>do not ever let them stop you doing what you're supposed to do</b>.
    </p>
    <p>

      I say to people often I haven't felt like going to the gym in two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm wearing my gym clothes right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just finished training.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't felt like training in two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I after 10 years of professional fighting after giving my life to exercise genuinely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not woke up and felt like oh I really want to train.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't felt that way in a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why I retired from fighting,
    </p>
    <p>
      but I have still gone and I have still trained<b>&#160;regardless of how I feel.</b>

    <p>
      So this is <b>one of the tenets</b>&#160;and there's going to be a lot of things you're going to learn of an iron mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Its the ability to not let your feelings affect you and sometimes to do the complete opposite of how you feel. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Because you're not going to very often feel like working hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're not going to always feel like doing the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're not always going to be motivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that you need to be constantly motivated shows how weak your mindset is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't need motivation to go to the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot want to go with every fiber of my being and I will still be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I use my cerebral ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use my mind and I logically decide what I'm going to do with my day regardless of how I feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether I'm motivated or not.

    <p>
      This course is going to be six weeks that's going to teach you how to put together a mindset that allows you to get things done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because that's all life is and that's all the world is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Life is just getting things done, doing the right things, doing the important things,</b>&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
      making sure they're done efficiently and thoroughly so that you live the best possible life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's as simple as that. It's not particularly complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of the lessons that you would need to learn<b><i><u>&#160;I gave out in my free video.</u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you've not seen that video once again the link is below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch that video for a start because that teaches you some very very important things about where your mind should be to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this six week training is going to be about exercises you can do to teach yourself slowly over time to put together a mindset that prevents you from failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because if you have a mindset that doesn't allow you to fail, then you're simply going to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's no other option.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's what this is all about.

    <p>
      So in the first week we're going to learn something which is extremely basic but it's extremely important.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not going to be and I don't want to be one of those guys who's like motivation inspirational.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've never been one of them people. I don't believe in motivation inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>I don't believe in that crap.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>I don't believe that you need motivation to get things done.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not going to sit here and just talk a whole bunch of motivational things to make you feel good.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      What I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you the things I always did that allowed me to put together the mindset I currently have.

      So if you look at any story, literally any story with a hero in it, they all have one thing in common and that thing is that <b>there's always a villain.</b>&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot have a hero without a villain. It doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can think of any superhero, any comic book, any book you can think of, any movie, there's always a good guy and there's a bad guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>So for the good guy to exist, there has to be a bad guy.</b>&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
      There's no other way for the duality of the universe to continue without this basic tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you want to be the good guy in your story.

      In every, I've said this before, actually, as a man, life is going to be difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's more difficult than being a woman is more difficult than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's very easy to see yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Life is actually easier as a whole if you see yourself as a hero. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because in every single hero's story, the hero suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has a hard time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you understand that <b>you're suffering because you're a hero, then the suffering begins to make sense. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

      So you can be sitting here right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      My woman doesn't respect me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no money in the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is difficult. I'm struggling here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm struggling there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>You can feel sorry for yourself or you can say,</b>&#160;yeah, my woman doesn't respect me. I'm struggling. I can't make money. But you know what?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's because I'm a fucking superhero.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my life's going to be hard because I'm a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as a hero, it's going to be difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the tests and the trials and tribulations I have to go through to become someone.

      Every single male superhero went through a whole ton of shit before he became superhero.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      You've seen the Batman movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His parents died. He was locked up in jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these bad things happen. And then they emerge as a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is done for a reason because it's the reality of life, especially as a man.

    <p>
      So right now, you have to <b>understand</b>&#160;that you're the hero in this movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you're struggling, <b>you're struggling for a very important reason. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And how you handle these struggles and how you deal with these struggles, you're going to decide the kind of person you're going to be afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're going to be a superhero or you're going to succumb to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're going to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>So be happy that you're struggling because that's important. </u></i></b>

      The <b>second thing</b>&#160;is there has to be a villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><u><b>Now most people think their villain is someone else.</b></u></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You see this all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villains opposite the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you're sitting at home and you haven't got much money and you're broke and you're pissed off and you're depressed and you look at me and I have four super cars and all these girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm traveling the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go everywhere I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>You may think I'm your villain. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      People look at other people and saying, oh, that guy has this.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guy has this and they become envious and I think that's the villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>That's not true. </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      That's not the case because every single person has<b><u>&#160;different circumstances.</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i><b>There are things you have that I don't have and the things I have that you don't have.</b></i></u>&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I may have had a genetic gift over you, for example, because I'm a fantastic kickboxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you may have been born more wealthy than me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in a very, very poor family.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I had advantages and disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      You had advantages and disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      So comparing yourself to other people is asinine and it's the name <b><i><u>because it's not a level fair playing ground. </u></i></b>

    <p>
      That's just how it is.

    <p>
      So comparing yourself to these people is not going to help you.

    <p>
      Your villain is nobody else.

    <p>
      <b>Your villain is someone you're going to create and you're going to create your villain <u><i>because he's going to motivate you</i></u>&#160;to be the most powerful hero you can possibly be. </b>

      This is a six week training course.

      And over each week you have a very important task.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the task for this week is to <b>create your villain.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure that there was no disadvantages involved, your villain is going to be a <b>clone of you</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what your villain is going to have is he's going to have some things you don't have.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your villain is going to be the person <b><u>who basically without requirement for motivation, without requirement, without being no matter how he feels that day or how stressed he is from work, regardless of what happens to him, your villain is going to be the guy who always does exactly what he wants to do.</u></b>

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Your villain is going to be the guy who approaches every beautiful girl he ever sees and says, Hey, I really think you're beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes over to him and talks to him.
    </p>
    <p>

      Your villain is going to be the guy who asks for a raise at work.

    </p>
    <p>
      So for this week you have to sit and you have to <b>make a list </b>of all the things you have to sit there and say, well I did everything I want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u><font color="#cc0000">If I were to be the best version of myself possible, what would I do?</font></u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, well I'd go to the gym every day. I get up at 6 a.m. and I'd go to the gym every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You write that down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd approach every beautiful girl I ever see and I'd introduce myself and try and get their Instagram on their number.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'd write that down.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      For example. I'd start a side business, even though I don't know anything about it, I'd learn how to make websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      My villain is the kind of guy who would sit there and you'd learn how to do it by himself and he'd start his own online business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write that down.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      My villain is the kind of guy who reads really important books. I say I don't have time, but my enemy, this villain, he reads books.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finds time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn't watch TV ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn't waste time ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn't eat junk food.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reads books right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      And you have to make a list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this list at first should be easy for you, but then you're going to get to about <b><i><u>seven or eight things you're going to stop.</u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, this list needs to be <b>25 to 30 points long, minimum. </b>

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      This guy you're building, your arch nemesis, you have to write down every single quality about this guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he does, it goes to the gym every day, 6am.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn't watch TV, he doesn't eat junk food.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes up to beautiful girls, etc, etc, etc. 25 are 30 points long,
    </p>
    <p>
      because this is going to become-your-enemy for the next six weeks of training.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      You want to become a hero, <b>you need someone to battle against</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is who you're battling against.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're battling against a better version of yourself, a version of yourself that doesn't succumb to how he feels, but does what he's supposed to do anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      So this is who your villain is going to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you're writing down this list, all the qualities your villain has, imagine what this person looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to put genuine effort into this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to imagine what he looks like, <b>imagine</b>&#160;how he walks, <b>imagine</b>&#160; how he talks, <b>imagine</b>&#160;what people think when they see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Imagine</b>&#160;how different you would be if you had been going to the gym every single day for an hour and a half, every single day, for the last two, three, four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine how different people would look at you, imagine how different females would treat you if you were a jack like that guy would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to sit and you have to put down all these qualities, and then once the qualities are there, 25 or 30 minimum, <b><i><u>then you have to imagine </u></i></b>what kind of person this is.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to imagine what he looks like, what he talks like, what he thinks like. Imagine how he views the world, because this is who you're going to be battling against.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      So you have to put genuine effort into constructing this person and understanding this person.

      <b><i><u>The reason I'm saying do this, because this is what motivates me every single day. </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was training for a fight, the reason I'd always go trains, because I knew my enemy was training.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I stopped fighting professionally, I thought, well, what enemy do I have? And I realized I had to create my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I don't feel like going to the gym, I imagine I've built my own enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't even list all the things that my enemy has.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has a whole bunch of shit I don't have.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he's a, he would be an impossible, nearly impossible person to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I sit and I don't feel like going to the gym, I know my enemy's training,
    </p>
    <p>
      because he trains no matter what, regardless of how he feels, regardless of he's pissed off, or if there's traffic or it's raining or he's tired, my enemy trains.

    </p>
    <p>
      When I see a girl and she's beautiful, but all her friends are there, I'm afraid they're going to laugh at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My enemy wouldn't give a fuck. He'd go over there anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's who he is. He's a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>So when I understood who I was truly battling against, and you have two choices, you either rise up to try and take him on, or you become a little pussy</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Do I want to lose to this man? This man I've created, and I've built, do I want to lose to him, or do I want to beat him or compete with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      And you have to make a choice, and you sit there and go, well, I know that the person I created in my mind, my arch nemesis would go over there, and he talked to all the girls, and he'd fuck two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let alone one.

    </p>
    <p>
      This is an extremely important facet, and for the next six weeks, when you're viewing lots of things that are going to revert back to the enemy that you've created, you'd have to put genuine effort into putting together this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to imagine everything about them. From start to finish, you have to imagine standing next to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were standing next to this guy right now with no shirt on, who would girls want to fuck, who would people respect?
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>And the crazy thing about all of this is that this person is you. </u></i></b>

      <b><i><u>This person is you. </u></i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It's just you with a little bit of a different path or a different take on life.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It's you who's the person who does whatever he's supposed to do regardless of how he feels.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It's you with an iron mind. </b>

    <p>
      This is the exact point of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason creating this enemy is so important, and the reason viewing him and seeing how he sees the world and understanding how important and powerful this person is, is important is because that person is you.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      That person is you who does what he's supposed to do without fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you truly, truly put this person together and you truly, truly understand him, and you find out what you could be and you find out what you're battling against,
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>you're going to become far more difficult to demotivate.&#160;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It's going to be much harder for someone to say to you, don't go to the gym because you're going to know, well, my enemy, this guy, give him a name, whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dude's going to the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why he looks how he looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's who I'm being compared to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I have to go to the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yeah, but you know, I'm tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you don't go then.
    </p>
    <p>
      My training part doesn't want to go fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't go. I am going. I'm not the guy who's going to let this man beat me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you have to start comparing yourself to this guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every single facet, I still do it to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I compare my bank balance to this guy, and he's killing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I compare my buddy to this guy. He's killing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I compare so many things about myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You guys may look at me and go, I'll take millionaire girls, this, that, that, that, I'm still comparing myself to this person I've created.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      And I know that I'm losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's what drives me forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why I don't miss the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's how I find a way to make money.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's how I do whatever it takes to succeed because I know who I'm battling against.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of you guys have no enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have no enemy, or you have an enemy which is somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>You're looking at Justin Bieber or Drake or some shit. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      That's not going to motivate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's pointless. It's not going to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you have no enemy at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have a support structure around you and you have people saying, oh, you're great just the way you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, you're beautiful just the way you are and you're sitting there and living in your little comfort zone, like a little bitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullshit.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Put this enemy together from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to email me the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email me the list. I'll see if there's anything you've missed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of you may notice that the bottom screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to email me your list. I'll compare it to my list and we'll see if there's anything you've missed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is going to be the most important thing across the next six weeks we're going to keep referring back to.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you truly put this list together, you truly create this person and truly understand that it could be you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's going to be far more difficult to stop you doing what you need to do in the future.
