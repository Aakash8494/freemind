      These are some small mind hacks.<br />This will be a quick video, but these are some small mind hacks you can do that will change your entire perspective.<br />Near instantly, and the first one, I alluded to a couple of these on Twitter, but this is the first one.<br /><b>The first one is a very, very important one.</b>&#160;It's probably the most important one.

      And it's changing, I have to, the sentence<b>&#160;I have to</b>, or the saying I have to,<br />into <b>I get to</b>.

      A lot of people are extremely <b>stressed</b>&#160;about things that they <b>have to do</b>.<br />And because they <b>have to do </b>them, or they understand the importance of doing them, they forget that it's actually a blessing to do them in the first place.<br />Because they're obligated, and you're obligated to do something, you forget that it's actually a good thing.<br />

      If I, like for example, going to the gym is <b>something people can enjoy</b>.<br />When I was a fighter and I had to go to the gym twice a day, every day, like anything in life, <b><u>once you're obligated, once you have to, a lot of the fun disappears.</u></b><br /><br />So <b>I have to</b>, implicates an <b>obligation</b>. Whereas I get to implicate a choice.<br /><br />So I'll give you an example. If you wake up and you're really busy, you think I have to take the kids to school, I have to go to work, I have to take the car to be repaired.<br />Those are three things which are not necessarily fun to do, they're not necessarily, they're everyday activities, they're things that you can be stressed about, you're low on time, you've got to get the kids ready for school, you've got to get to work, I was the problem with the car.<br /><br />If you change, I have to do those three things, and I get to do those three things. <b><u>The mentality around the actions change.</u></b><br /><br />

      So I get to take the kids to school.<br />A lot of people don't have kids, a lot of people want kids and can't get them.<br />There's a lot of kids who can't go to school.<br />You get to take your children to school, which is, which is the blessing in itself.<br />I have to take the kids to school, you get to take them to school, aren't you lucky?<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#160;have to go to work, well you get to go to work.<br />Imagine you didn't have a job.<br />Imagine right now you lost your job.<br />If you lost your job right now overnight and you had no income, your whole life would be an upside down, it would be in turmoil.<br />I need to miss your job very much and you wish you had your job back.<br /><br /><b><u>So you get to go to work. You don't have to go to work, you get to go to work. That's what's a good thing.</u></b>&#160;<br /><br />

    <p>
      Even something as annoying as a car burden, I have to take the car to the mechanics.<br />Well at least you get to take the car with the mechanics.<br />Imagine you didn't have a car.<br />Imagine there was no mechanic.<br /><br />So next time you're sitting there looking at your day or looking at a list of things or jobs you have to complete or you're stressed or low on time and all these things are happening,<br />I have to do this, I've got to get this done, I have to do this, I have to do this.<br /><br />Change the language. I get to do x, y, z and I guarantee you'll feel better about the activities near instantly.<br />And this is something you can do very, very quickly. It's the first thing you need to do.<br /><br />

      And this is the <b>second little mind hack</b>&#160;and this video is short because I want you to implement these. I want you to take time to genuinely make sure you implement these two things.<br />Change I have to, I get to and the <b><u>second one is and then I can</u></b>.<br />

    <p>
      So when you have to do something difficult, <b><u>add and then I can on the end.</u></b><br />For example, with me, the gym, I'm being honest with you. I don't like the gym anymore.<br />I'm doing it too long, but I understand it's important and I don't want to miss it.<br />So I think you know what,<b><u>&#160;I'm going to go train, I'm going to train hard<br />because then I can relax.</u></b>&#160;<br />

    <p>
      So adding and then I get to onto the end of basically anything <b>can give you a lot of motivation.</b><br />So even the simple activities we labeled earlier, I have two things.<br />I have to get the kids ready for school, I have to go to work, I have to fix the car.<br /><br />If you change it to I get to take the kids to school, I get to go to work, I get to get the car fixed<b>&#160;and then I can relax.</b><br /><br />And then I'm going to treat myself and allow myself to have a glass of wine or some ice cream, whatever.<br /><br />Add and then onto the end of everything with difficult task and
    </p>
    <p>
      change I have to, I get to try that for a week and you'll see exactly how your entire world changes.
